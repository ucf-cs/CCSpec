<!--    <h1>CCSpec: A Correctness Condition Specification Tool</h1> -->

        <p class="lead"> CCSpec is a tool that allows the user to check that their concurrent data structure meets a specified correctness condition. A correctness condition for a concurrent data structure defines the expected behavior of method calls. CCSpec can check any correctness condition in which a concurrent data structure is expected to exhibit equivalent behavior to the sequential counterpart. </p>

        <h3>Wait-Free</h3>
        <p>
        Wait-freedom is the strongest non-blocking guarantee of progress, it guarantees system-wide progress and starvation-freedom. An algorithm is wait-free if every operation has a bound on the number of steps the algorithm will take before the operation completes. This property is critical for real-time systems.

        <h3>Framework</h3>
        <p>
        As a framework, Tervel provides to API, tools, and examples to enable developers to craft their own wait-free algorithms. By providing implementations of memory management, progress assurance, and other constructs, Tervel allows the developer to focus on the correctness and performance of their approach. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Library</h3>
        <p>
        As a library, Tervel provides several wait-free algorithms and containers, with plans to expand its collection in the near future.  The concurrent API used in the implementation of these algorithms removes ambiguousness found in the sequential API, improving the developer ability to reason about correctness.
