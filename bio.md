# The Research Group

The Computer Software Engineering - Scalable and Secure Systems (CSE - S3) Lab at the University of Central Florida was established by Dr. Damian Dechev in 2010. His work focuses on concurrency and multithreading using C++. Dr. Dechev completed his Ph.D. degree in 2009 at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. The CSE-S3 lab has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Department of Energy.

# Key Tervel Developers[^0]
<h3> Steven Feldman</h3>
Steven Feldman received his MS degrees in computer science from the University of Central Florida, in 2013. His research interests include concurrency, inter-thread helping techniques, and progress conditions.
This had lead to the development of several wait-free algorithms.

<h3> Carlos Valera-Leon</h3>
Carlos Valera-Leon received his BS degree in computer science from the University of Central Florida, in 2014. His interests include concurrent algorithms, synchronization techniques, and distributed systems.
